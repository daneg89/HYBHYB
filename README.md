Steganography project - Hide Your Bits, Hide Your Bytes

This Python program will be able to hide data inside other files. Supported files to hide data in will be:

BMP - 8-bit (grayscale and palette), 24-bit (true color)
GIF (GIF87a) - grayscale and palette
JPEG - 8-bit (grayscale) and 24-bit (true color)
PNG - 8-bit (grayscale and palette), 24-bit (true color)

This program is designed to work on Linux operating systems ONLY. Since there is no GUI, all interactions are done on the command line

No installation mechanism has been provided for the program. If you want to set it up to run, do the following:

1. Create a directory to run the program from
2. Run the setup script inside the directory created in step #1
3. If not done already, install the IJG JPEG and and ZLIB compression libraries 
4. Install Pillow 2.4.0

Note however that the project is still being built and won't be ready for a bit.
